Simple CD cover made from folding a single A4 sheet of paper.

See http://www.instructables.com/id/OpenCDCover-II/ for folding instructions.

Copy this directory into your user template directory:

    cp -r ../Paper\ Fold ~/.scribus/templates/

And you should be able to use the "New from template" feature to create a new
document based on this layout.
